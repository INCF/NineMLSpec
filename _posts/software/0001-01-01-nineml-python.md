[The NineML Python Library](http://github.com/INCF/nineml-python) is a software
library written in Python, which maps the NineML object model onto Python
classes for convenient creation, manipulation and validation of NineML models,
as well as handling their serialization to and from XML, JSON, YAML, Python
Pickle, and HDF5.
