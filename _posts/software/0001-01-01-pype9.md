["PYthon PipelinEs for 9ml (Pype9)"](http://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/pype9)
is a collection of software Python pipelines to simulate neuron, and
neuron network, models described in NineML using either Neuron or NEST
as simulator backends.

Pype9 has a Command Line Interface (CLI), which allows experiments to
be simulated directly from NineML descriptions (i.e. without scripting).
Alternatively, simulations can be embedded within Python scripts with
Pype9â€™s accessible Public API.
