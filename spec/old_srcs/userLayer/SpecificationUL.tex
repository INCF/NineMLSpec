\abstract
This draft intends to describe our current opinions on User Layer concepts
of NineML.

This work currently summarizes the different ideas and propositions elaborated
during eight Task Force meetings and User Layer group discussions. It might
contain some misrepresentations or omissions of important issues and shall be
updated in finalizing for public release at CNS 2011.

\vskip 1in

\paragraph{Changes from version 0.93:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cut out the group and set sections since they are not part of the release
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Changes from version 0.92:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Adapted the format similar to the Abstraction layer specification.
I think this document shall essentially become user layer section of the
general specification document.
\item Attempted to reorganize and adapt the text to be more like ``Object
Model'' for the User Layer.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Changes from version 0.91:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Replaced ``node'' with ``component'' as was decided in Antwerp 2010
meeting.
\item Replaced references to ``core semantics'' with references to
``abstraction layer''
because the term ``core semantics'' is no longer used.
\item As Antwerp 2010 decided, properties are represented by a generic
tag and specified
by attribute {\tt name}.
\item Added the reference to units of measurements dimensionality checking
against
the abstraction layer as was decided in Antwerp 2010.
\item Moved edge effect descriptions from connectivity components to layout
components. Also
noted that some layouts might require complex masks.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Changes from version 0.9:}
\begin{itemize}
\item added footnotes for some issues raised in Stockholm June meeting
\item added brief description of interactions between user layer and
simulation software that does not support abstraction layer
\item removed random number generator nodes as decided in Stockholm
\item added space, region, and layout nodes as a first draft of geometrical
concepts (based on NetworkML proposal by Padraig and Robert as well as
Stockholm discussions)
\item removed recurrent projections that can be described on the population
level
\item cut out the previous approach to cell positioning within population
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}

With an increasing number of studies related to large-scale neuronal
network modeling, the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating
Facility (INCF) has identified a need for standards and guidelines to
ease model sharing and facilitate the replication of results across
different simulators. To create such standards, the INCF has formed a
program on Multiscale Modeling to develop a common standardized
description language for neuronal network models.

The name of the proposed standard is NineML (Network Interchange for
Neuroscience Modeling Language) and its first version is aimed at
descriptions of large networks of spiking neurons.

\subsection{Language syntax}

It is envisioned that the language should not require a
specific syntax or rely on any given technology or platform.
Rather it is anticipated that the language can be
employed by defining the model elements in a variety of different
syntaxes including a native (domain specific) language, Python, Java,
and XML (for example).

\subsection{Scope of the User Layer}

The user layer provides the syntax for specifying the model and parameters to
be used to instantiate the key elements of a spiking neuronal network in terms
that are directly linked to the biological counterparts of the model. This
includes descriptions of individual elements (cells, synapses, inputs).

The remainder of this document summarizes the concepts that underlie user
layer design.

\section{Core Concepts}

User layer has five key elements: data types, property, definition,
component, and projection. The following subsections
discuss each of these elements.

\subsection{Data types}

Data types are the objects that allow the encapsulation of necessary data
and are not intended as standalone objects but rather as parts of composite
objects like {\tt property}.

\subsubsection{Dimension}

Dimension is an object that provides physical dimension like length,
mass, or time. A set of predefined dimensions is provided in the
NineML library and the user can derive compound dimensions from these
(for example velocity is derived from length and time). A special case
of a {\tt Dimension} is a predefined empty dimension for dimensionless
quantities.

\subsubsection{Number}

Number is a object that represents numerical values. It is not designed for
a direct use, but rather as a component of the {\tt Quantity} type that
additionally includes the units of measurements for each specific quantity.

\subsubsection{String}

String is an object that contains a string of text. It is used for labeling
elements as well as for optional textual {\tt note}s that annotate these
elements.

\subsubsection{URL}

URL is an object that contains a reference to an internet resource in a form
of a URL. It is used for abstraction layer or external definitions as well as
for links in optional {\tt note}s that annotate these elements.

\subsubsection{Enumerated}

Enumerated is an object that is used for properties that can only take
a few predefined by abstraction layer values.

\subsubsection{Boolean}

Boolean is an object that contains a binary true-false value or a logical
expression that can be evaluated into such a value.

\subsubsection{Function}

Function is an object that returns a value of a {\tt Number} type resulting
from calculation that can be deterministic or based on random number
distribution.

\subsubsection{Quantity}

Quantity is a compound data type object that encapsulates a numerical value
and a unit of measurements. Unit has to be of one of the {\tt Dimension} type.
Any numeric quantity in the language (except counters) has to be of this type,
dimensionless quantities shall use predefined empty {\tt Dimension}.

\begin{table}[htb]
\center
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
\hline
Quantity \\
\hline
\hline
{\em unit}: {\tt Dimension} \\
\hline
{\em value}: \{{\tt Number}$|${\tt Function}$|$%
{\tt Component->Random Distribution}\} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

There are two kinds of quantities: values of the first kind are given to the
model by the user and stay fixed, values of a second kind are computed within
the model during simulation. For all practical reasons the syntax of the user
layer descriptions is identical for both kinds of quantities. Furthermore,
because NineML does not provide any default values for quantities, it is a
job of the user to provide initial values for all defined quantities. To
ensure the integrity of the model NineML requires all initial values to be
set in the user layer description. For batch simulations and other
modifications any of the values given in the user layer can be overwritten
by a simulation setup description, but this is outside of the scope of the
current version of NineML.

Some quantities can have values drawn from random distribution. In this case
user layer description of the quantities includes a reference to a random
distribution component (section \ref{randDist}) instead of a numeric value.
Other quantities might be calculated according to some function dependent on
some other quantities. These can be defined through the type {\tt Function} by
including inline abstraction layer definitions or MathML.

\subsection{Property}

Property is a construct that combines a value of one of the data types
defined in the previous subsection, an indicator of the used type, and a
label. The label should match the corresponding label in the Abstraction
Layer definition.

\begin{table}[htb]
\center
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
\hline
Property \\
\hline
\hline
{\em label}: {\tt String} \\
\hline
{\em value}: \{{\tt Quantity}$|${\tt Boolean}$|${\tt Enumerated}\} \\
\hline
{\em note}: \{{\tt String}$|${\tt URL}\} (optional)\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The user can set the value of the property and (when applicable for the data
type, e.g. {\tt Quantity}) the units of measurement. These units are also
checked against the dimensionality of the corresponding property definition
in the abstraction layer.

User can add a note to a property. These notes are
intended to provide a specific reference to the research paper page
where the component is described and similar kind of information. These
notes are not intended to duplicate the abstraction layer documentation
or any other documentation, thus they shall not provide mathematical
description and other details of the component implementation. Note can
contain text (type {\tt String}) or link to an Internet resource (type
{\tt URL}).

\subsection{Definition}

All constructs in the user layer have their mathematical or algorithmical
definitions in the abstraction layer. Definition is an object that
establishes a link between user layer and abstraction layer. The initial
version of NineML allows to put references to external (including user
space abstraction layer) definitions.

\begin{table}[htb]
\center
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
\hline
Definition \\
\hline
\hline
{\em language}: {\tt String} \\
\hline
{\em link}: {\tt URL}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The language should be flexible enough to allow representation of concepts
that do not yet exist, as it is developed to serve the forefront of research.
A simple mechanism to add concepts that are not part of the standard is
provided through external (other than abstraction layer based) definitions.
It is the choice of a simulator developer to support these definitions during
initial stage of NineML development. Future
maturation of NineML shall eliminate the need to support simulator-specific
definitions.

\subsection{Reference}

Reference is an object that can replace {\tt Definition} object in situations
where user needs to reuse the same definition for multiple instances of
objects. In this case the first instance shall be described using
{\tt Definition} and the rest can use the first one through {\tt Reference}.
Label in the {\tt Reference} must match a label in a previously defined
object.

\begin{table}[htb]
\center
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
\hline
Reference \\
\hline
\hline
{\em label}: {\tt String} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Component}

The basic building block of NineML is called component. In the user layer
description component is a reference to an object defined in the abstraction
layer. Abstraction layer defines the mathematics of the component and this
definition is then referred in the user layer through an object of type
{\tt Definition}.

\begin{table}[htb]
\center
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
\hline
Component \\
\hline
\hline
{\em label}: {\tt String} \\
\hline
{\em definition}: \{{\tt Definition}$|${\tt Reference}\}\\
\hline
{\em note}: \{{\tt String}$|${\tt URL}\} (optional)\\
\hline
\colorbox{issuecolor}{\parbox{0.4\linewidth}
{\center Set of {\tt Property} objects}} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

In addition to the {\tt Definition} object, the component encapsulates
user-given ID or label, and a set of {\tt Property} objects. The composition
of this set of properties is defined in the abstraction layer (or externally)
and instantiated in the user layer description of component. The mapping
between mathematical description of the object in the abstraction
layer and the corresponding properties labels in the user layer are
provided in this specification.

User can add short notes to each component's description similar to
notes described above for properties.

To reduce the size of the resulting model description user can refer to
already described component by referencing their label instead of providing
a link to the abstraction layer or external definition. In this case the
properties of the component that have to be redefined are stated explicitly,
the properties that are inherited from the original description are omitted.

If the simulator only supports user layer, then the simulator developers
can create mappings directly between the reference to a definition in the
user layer description of the component and the intrinsic simulator code
that implements the same mathematics.

\subsubsection{Random Distribution Components}
\label{randDist}

This component allows to define random distribution with corresponding
parameters. These component allows the reuse of the same distribution
multiple times similar to reuse of all other components.

\subsubsection{Neuronal Components}
\label{neuron}

The description of the neuronal component defines a prototypical neuron
which can be reused multiple times within the network. As a consequence,
multiple connectivity patterns can be applied to this neuron, which
results in a different set of synaptic inputs. Therefore, no description
of these inputs shall be provided at the component level, they shall be
described at the projection level (Section \ref{projections}). Simulation
software shall take care of complete construction of each neuron by
analyzing both levels of description.

\subsubsection{Plasticity Components}
\label{plasticity}

Plasticity components handle the synaptic weight and its possible
modification. Note that synaptic weight is a dimensionless quantity and
as such always have units of the predefined empty {\tt Dimension}. This
is done to allow same plasticity rules to operate on
different types of postsynaptic responses. Synaptic weight defined in the
plasticity component determines only the magnitude of the response, the
shape and physical properties are defined in the corresponding post-synaptic
response node (section \ref{secSynapse}).

\subsubsection{Post-synaptic Response (PSR) Components}
\label{secSynapse}

Post-synaptic response components define the effect imposed on the
post-synaptic cell dynamics by triggering the synaptic input. This
definition includes only the shape of this effect and does not include the
exact magnitude of the effect. The magnitude is described separately through
plasticity rules and synaptic weights in section \ref{plasticity}. Note
though that the units of the effect are defined here and synaptic weights in
plasticity nodes are left dimensionless.

\subsection{Projection}
\label{projections}

A projection holds a description of the connectivity between two
cells. The projection does not create any new components. The purpose of
projection object is to bind source and destination components using
a certain plasticity rule and post-synaptic response.

\begin{table}[htb]
\center
\begin{tabular}{|c|}
\hline
\hline
Projection \\
\hline
\hline
{\em label}: {\tt String} \\
\hline
{\em source}: {\tt Component->Neuron} \\
\hline
{\em destination}: {\tt Component->Neuron} \\
\hline
{\em synapse}: {\tt Component->PSR} \\
\hline
{\em plasticity}: {\tt Component->Plasticity} \\
\hline
{\em note}: \{{\tt String}$|${\tt URL}\} (optional)\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Projection description includes references to a plasticity component
that controls the synaptic weight (section \ref{plasticity}) and
post-synaptic response node that controls the influence of the input
through this projection on the post-synaptic cell dynamics (section
\ref{secSynapse}). Both appear in the description of the projection
rather than neuron because the same type of neuron can use different
synapses, similarly the same postsynaptic response can be used in
multiple projections with different plasticity rules. Instead of providing
the user with all possible pre-wired combinations, NineML allows user
to combine the plasticity$\rightarrow$response$\rightarrow$neuron
chain from a set of small standard components.

\section{Structure of a User Layer Description}

In order to simplify the descriptions themselves and the mechanisms for
combining multiple components of the model the user layer description
is consisting of multiple files that define various components and
contains the syntax to import external files.

\subsection{Scope of User Layer Descriptions}
\label{scope}

In order to avoid the collisions of user-given IDs as well as to
provide the user with the ability to redefine some of the imported
components the following set of rules is suggested:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Every identifier is considered unique only within its parent}
\item{To access the identifier a full path from the point of access
to this identifier shall be provided.}
\item{Any imported construct can be redefined within the importing
description by adding a new definition of the same object. All properties
of the imported object are imported from external file and the values of
some (or even all) of them are overwritten by the local description.}
\item{If multiple redefinitions of the same entity are found, then the most
recent one will be used. The most recent is determined by the order of
parsing of the top level model description file. Here the rule shall be
enforced that when multiple files are included all nodes are parsed before
all groups. This will allow a smooth transition from networks with simple
nodes and groups to networks where some nodes and some groups are redefined.}
\item{If several different subfields are redefined in different places of the
description, then all of these new definitions will be used. Please note that
this is not the optimal way, and the better way to achieve the same effect is
to provide all redefinitions in a unique location. Simulation software
developers can (but at this point of time are not obliged to) optimize the
NineML code that is output by their software by grouping all redefinitions
of components of the same node into a single node.}
